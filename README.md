# GenerAIte - Major League Hacking (web3apps 29 - 31 December)

## Inspiration
The inspiration behind GenerAIte stems from the realization that accessing unique and customizable NFT art is often limited. Traditional platforms lack the diversity and personalization sought by digital art enthusiasts and collectors.

### What it does
GenerAIte is an innovative solutionâ€”an AI-powered NFT image generator that transforms the landscape of digital art. It provides users with the ability to access on-demand, one-of-a-kind digital artworks, each a testament to the fusion of advanced generative algorithms and blockchain technology.

### How we built it
We built GenerAIte by leveraging cutting-edge technology:

Generative Algorithm: Our system is powered by state-of-the-art generative algorithms. Through extensive training on diverse datasets, our AI creates truly unique and captivating digital art pieces. Blockchain Integration: Smart contracts play a crucial role in the seamless functioning of GenerAIte. They handle the minting process, ownership tracking, and secure transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

### Challenges we ran into
One notable challenge we faced was the integration of starknet.js, a vital component for achieving efficient layer 2 scaling on the Ethereum network. Overcoming this hurdle required intricate technical expertise, collaboration, and persistence.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Amidst the challenges, we successfully achieved key milestones:

IPFS Integration: We managed to upload files to the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), ensuring decentralized and resilient storage for our digital assets. Smart Contract Deployment: Our team accomplished the deployment of smart contracts, facilitating secure and transparent interactions on the blockchain. Functional Image Generator: The heart of GenerAIte, our image generator, is fully functional, consistently producing diverse and visually stunning artworks. What we learned The project presented a unique learning opportunity, especially in coding for layer 2 Ethereum. Our team gained valuable insights into the intricacies of layer 2 scaling solutions, enhancing our skill set in blockchain development.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
